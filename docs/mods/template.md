### Installation Instructions
1. Download **[Old Files - Fallout 4 Script Extender (F4SE) 0.6.23 :material-tray-arrow-down:](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42147?tab=files&file_id=253313)** from Nexusmods
2. From the downloaded archive, extract ==everything== to the game's Root folder.
3. Restart your mod manager (MO2)
    

???+ question "What is the Root Folder?"
    If you do not know what the Root folder is, read the Key Terminology section from the Initial Setup page.

### Check if F4SE was correctly installed

:material-information-box:
**Note:** You need to check both the **Root Folder** and **MO2**.

!!! example ""
    === "Inside the Root Folder"

        If you did everything correctly, your **Root Folder** should look like this:

        ![F4SE in Root folder](../assets/images/root.webp "F4SE in Root folder")

    === "Inside MO2"
        In order for the script extender to work, you need to **always** launch the game using the **f4se_loader.exe** file. 
        It will automatically be added to Mod Organizer 2 upon restarting it.
