#### 8. Weather Mods

Weather mods need to be loaded here.

**Notes** 

- The Automatic Load Order checker below does not know which mods are weather mods, and therefore might complain. You can ignore the load order checker in such cases. Certain Weather mods are esm files and can't be loaded here. In that case they need to be loaded at the top of the load order (see rule 1), and require a patch for FROST that needs to be loaded here.
- NACX does not need a patch for FROST anymore and needs to be loaded at the top of the load order

#### 9. Frost Cell Fixes (FCF)

No other files should come after the FCF .esp files, except very special mods (see rule 10).
If you don't follow these rules, bad things will happen!
The FCF_Main.esp and FCF_Previsibines.esp must come first, and in the same order as below. After those two plugins all other FCF plugins must be loaded.

- FCF_Main.esp
- FCF_Previsibines.esp
- (Additional FCF files for patching certain mods)
- FCF_Hotfix.esp (only if there is a Hotfix for FCF)
- ...

#### 10. Exceptions to Rule 9


If you use the following plugins, they need to be loaded after FCF.
Keep in mind that this list is not complete. 
These mods either have speciallcell headers that can be safely loaded after FCF, or provide their own precombines/previs data which needs to overwrite FCF. 
If you use a sorting mod, make sure to let it generate a sorting plugin for your load order specifically, and load it after all other plugins.

- PLI_USAF_Satellite_Station_Olivia.esp
- PLI_USAF_Olivia FROSTified.esp
- Vivid Waters.esp
- Synthesis.esp
- SatelliteWorldMap.esp
- FOLIP - Before Generation.esp
- People Live In mods by Glitchfinder + their FCF patches
- We Can Live In by Glitchfinder + their FCF patches
- (Auto-Generated Item Sorting Mod plugin)
