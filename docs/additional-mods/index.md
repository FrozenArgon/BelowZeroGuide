# Additional Mods

## Recommended mods

This section contains some recommended mods that you might want to add to your mod setup.
All of the mods here are subjective recommendations.
Some of them might make FROST easier or more difficult.

!!! warning "Put on your big boy/girl pants!"
    Not all mods listed here are necessarily compatible with each other!

    The installation instructions provided for the mods in this section should be taken with a grain of salt! 
    
    They might be wrong or don't contain all necessary steps.

## READ THIS!

!!! warning "Use your brain!"

    The installation instructions provided for the mods in this section should be taken with a grain of salt!
    They might be wrong or don't contain all necessary steps.
    This part of the guide does not hold your hand when it comes to downloading and installing mods.

    ==Always== read the description page of each mod and check out which requirements it needs.

    ==Always== check if you need a specific version of a mod or any additional patches.

    ==Not all mods in this section can be installed or removed mid-playthrough== 

    Use these mods at your own risk and responsibility.


!!! info "Loose Files and Packed Files"

    A lot of mods in this section ship their textures and other assets as loose files. 
    I recommend to package them into BA2 files, and to manually resolve file conflicts before doing so.
