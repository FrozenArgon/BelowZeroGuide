## Why do weapon mods need a patch for FROST?
 Using them without a patch for FROST can cause several problems like:

* **CTDs** (caused by template issues or mesh problems)
* **Weapons not spawning** on NPCs or elsewhere at all
* NPCs only running around with the new weapon but not with any other weapon
  * This problem gets worse with higher player levels
* **Immersion/Lore breaking** quests, NPCs or items
* New weapons are either **over-powered or under-powered**
* General **balancing issues**
* **Conflicts** with Leveled Lists, World Objects, ...
* ...

Simple weapon mesh, texture or animation replacers do not always need a FROST patch.
Check the load order section on where to put the weapon mods and their FROST patches.

## How can I patch weapons myself for FROST?
[Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/3628) is an article on how to do that.
You obviously require xEdit and some CK knowledge to patch weapons properly.
