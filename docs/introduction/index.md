# Introduction

## Overview

==Below Zero== is a modding guide for Fallout 4 that will carefully walk you through how to install all the mods you will need for a perfectly stable, smooth and enjoyable experience centered around the **[FROST Survival Simulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18898)**  mod.

The **[FROST Survival Simulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18898)** is a total game overhaul mod, which isn't compatible with some other mods or other Fallout 4 setup tutorials. Everything that is mentioned in this guide is free to install and doesn't cost anything (with the obvious exception of **Fallout 4**).

The guide is highly accessible for everyone, no matter your modding experience. It is still incredibly important that you read all the instructions very carefully, even if you believe you are experienced enough to skip them. There are many small instructions that are vital for your game to function, and could be easily missed if you aren't careful. Although you don't need any modding experience to use this guide, it is expected for you to be relatively experienced with operating a computer in general. 

## Important Information
* The guide is focused around using ==MO2==
    * I do ==not== recommend to use Vortex, MO2 is better
    * You can still use **Vortex** or **NMM** for FROST if you want
    * We can not offer **Vortex**/**NMM** specific support
* This guide requires ==downgrading Fallout 4== for better mod support
    * We walk you through this process, it is very easy
* I recommend reading this guide once before following its instructions
* You can have a ==FROST== and a ==non-FROST== Fallout 4 setup at the same time
    * Read the [FAQ](faq) for more information about that
* The **GOG** and **Vortex** instructions in this guide are WIP and experimental
* Make sure to check out the [FAQ](../faq/index.md) page and the [**FROST Discord :simple-discord:**](https://discord.com/invite/BaKsm7Fn4A)

## Using this guide
After reading this **Introduction**, you need to read the **[Requirements](./requirements)** page.
Following that, you can follow the actual **[Guide](../guide)**, which contains 10 Sections which walk you through setting up the game and all required (and optional) mods.
It also contains 2 optional sections for troubleshooting and for adding more mods.
You can use the **Next** button at the bottom of each page to go to the next step of the guide for easier navigation.

## A note for inexperienced/new modders
Some newer players have mentioned that this guide feels long or that setting up FROST seems like a lot of work. In reality, about 90% of the Below Zero guide focuses on helping you build a proper, scalable, modern, and stable Fallout 4 setup — only about 10% is specifically about FROST itself. If parts of the guide seem unfamiliar, or if you notice mods you hadn’t used before, it likely just means your previous setups didn’t follow a fully optimized and modern approach.

If everyone knew by default how to make proper Fallout 4 setups, this guide would be *way* shorter.

Additionally, a lot of people have blamed FROST for vanilla bugs or bugs caused by broken mod setups.
The number of false bug reports from players have been dropped dramatically since the creation of the Below Zero guide.
